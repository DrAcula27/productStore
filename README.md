# productStore

## Per Scholas - Week 9 - Front-end, Express, and MongoDB - MODULE 2 PROJECT: Product Store

### Project Details

**Navigation between pages should be done with a `navbar` (using JS to switch html files) AND/OR by clicking on things in the page (JS switches html files)**

#### Pages

1. HOME page (index):
    - All the products are displayed.
    - The user can visit each product from here.
    - If the user clicks on the image, it links to the PRODUCT page.
    - There is a link to add a new product.
1. PRODUCT page:
    - Shows specific product and itâ€™s details.
    - Has a link back to the HOME page.
    - Has a link to edit the product that goes to the EDIT page.
    - Has a delete button that deletes that specific product.
    - The user can also search for a specific product from this page.
    - Clicking the buy button should lower the remaining inventory by 1.
    - If the quantity of the product is zero, its product page should say 'OUT OF STOCK' instead of saying how many are remaining.
    - The BUY button should not be rendered if the product is out of stock.
1. EDIT page:
    - Allows the user to edit the data of a specific product using itâ€™s product ID.
1. CREATE page:
    - Allows for the creation of new products (users will include a URL for the image).

#### Redirects

1. The `create` route should redirect to HOME after creation.
1. The `delete` route should redirect to HOME after deletion.
1. The `edit` route will redirect to the edited product's PRODUCT page after the object is changed in the collection.

#### ðŸ”´ Mandatory To Pass
**The app must possess the following routes:**
1. `/get_products` - responds with all products in the collection.
1. `/get_specific_product/:product_id` - responds with one specific product from the collection.
1. `/create_product` - uses information from `req.body` to make a new product in the collection.
1. `/delete_product` - uses the product ID in the URL as a query.
    - Example: `/delete_product/?productId=63cd55e8b260470b1c1f2cc0`
1. `/update_product` - uses information from `req.body` to update the specific product.

#### Technical Requirements
1. The app must run without syntax errors.
1. The app must contain all routes listed above.
1. The app must be styled and look like a store.
1. The app must have a well documented README file.
    - Add this README.md file manually, NOT through GitHub.
1. Create a video showcasing the application and code. This video needs to be in the README file.
